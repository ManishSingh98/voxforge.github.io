## QuickStart download

This QuickStart download was designed to highlight the use of _VoxForge Acoustic Models_ with Open Source Speech Recognition Engines.  We will start with a download that uses the Julius Speech Recognition Engine.   

These downloads contain everything you need to get Julius working:

    *   Julius Speech Recognition Engine executables;
    *   VoxForge Acoustic Model files; and
    *   VoxForge sample Grammar files.

Click the link for your operating system for the and follow the instructions in the enclosed README file.  You can also try one of the [Nightly Builds](http://www.repository.voxforge1.org/downloads/Nightly_Builds/) for the most up to date version of the Acoustic Models.

 

**Note:** A "Speech Recognition Engine" (like Julius) is only one component of a Speech Command and Control System (where you can speak a command and the computer does something).  You still need a [Dialog Manager](/home/docs/faq/faq/what-is-a-dialog-manager) to understand what to do with the recognition results from the speech recognition engine (i.e. to take the words recognized by the Speech Recognition Engine, and make the computer do something useful).
