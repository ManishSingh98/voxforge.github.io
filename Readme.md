VoxForge collects high fidelity spoken audio for use with [Free] and [Open Source], 
[Speech Recognition Engines] in many languages.  

The audio is recorded at the highest quality sampling rate available to your 
browser/operating system.  It is recorded in WAV format, an uncompressed, lossless, 
audio format.  Most open corpora are recorded in lossy formats (such as mp3 or vorbis).

The audio collected is not necessarily 'clean speech' but is meant to
reflect audio conditions 'in the wild' in order to create better acoustic 
models, and to provide a better test set for evaluating [Speech Recognition Engines].
