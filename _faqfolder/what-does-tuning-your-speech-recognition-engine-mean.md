When the commercial SRE providers say that you need to 'tune' the SRE to your location, they are saying that you (or their consultants) need to either:

*   update your Acoustical Model to contain pronunciations of words that are unique to your region, or
*   increase the probability of occurrence of such regional pronunciations in your Grammar.
