**Free software** is [software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software") that gives users the four essential freedoms:

*   to run the program, for any purpose
*   to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.  Access to the [source code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) is a precondition for this. 
*   to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor, and

*   to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.  Access to the [source code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) is a precondition for this.

For more information, see the definition of [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) on the [Free Software Foundation's](http://www.fsf.org/) (FSF) website.  The FSF promotes the development and use of [free software](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html), particularly the GNU operating system, used widely in its GNU/Linux variant.
