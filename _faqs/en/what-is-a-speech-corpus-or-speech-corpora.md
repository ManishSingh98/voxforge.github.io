A Speech Corpus (or Spoken Corpus) is a database of speech audio files and text transcriptions of these audio files in a format that can be used to create Acoustical Models (which can then be used with a Speech Recognition Engine).  ISIP's [Switchboard](http://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/switchboard/) database is a good example of this.

A corpus is one such database.  Corpora is the plural of corpus (i.e. it is many such databases).

There are two types of Speech Copora:

(1) Read Speech - which includes

*   Book excerpts;
*   Broadcast news;
*   Lists of words;
*   Sequences of numbers.

(2) Spontaneous Speech - which includes:

*   Dialogs - between two or more people (includes meetings);
*   Narratives - a person telling a story;
*   Map-tasks -  one person explains a route on a map to another;
*   Appointment-tasks - two people try to find a common meeting time based on individual schedules.
