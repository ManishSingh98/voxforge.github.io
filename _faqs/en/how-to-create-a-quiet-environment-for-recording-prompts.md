How to Create a Quiet Environment for Recording Prompts?

Before you begin, you need to make sure that the room you are recording in is 
as quiet as possible.  You do not need an acoustically sound-proof room, 
but you need to make sure that, while you are recording, there are no external 
noises that your microphone might pick up and which may render you speech audio 
files unusable for Acoustic Model creation purposes.  Use common sense: you 
should not have any music in the background, no fans, air conditioners, 
microwaves, television, etc.  In addition, make sure you turn off you 
speakers *while recording* - to avoid acoustic feedback in your audio files.

**macavity also says**:

Shortly put, creating a good recording place boils down to two things:

1) Eliminating external noise.

2) Breaking up as much surface as possible to avoid echo.

 

 As to the elimination of external noise, there is only so much you can do 
without spending a small [or huge] fortune: Pick a room that is the furthest 
away from trafic-noise. Close doors and windows. Shut the blinders/pull the 
curtains. (I take it that you have read the documentation, so telling you to 
turn off the aircondition/fan etc. should not be nessecary at this point).

 Now we get to the FUN part! You see, the art of braking surface is the art of 
doing what your mother told you never to do: Making A Mess(TM)! Thats right. 
What you need to do is to "scientifically" make a mess of the room. First, if 
there is no carpet on the floor, spreading out books with about a foot apart is 
a good start, but don't forget to make them stand up open if they can. Also, 
moving all the plants you have in the other rooms into your recording studio 
gives good results, as plants have a huge surface. Preferably the plants are 
placed on chairs, or the like, evenly distributed in the room. But the big 
problem is the walls... bare walls kill good recordings! Closets, "littered" 
shelves, racks and framed pictures help a lot here. Just remember that pictures 
with glass covers are actually worse than a bare wall, as glass bounces more 
sound than wallpaper! And while we are at it.. so does the hard unbroken 
surface of a door. The only easy/cheap way I can come up with is to place a 
mattress in front of it, or if it has a hook, hang your biggest coat on it. 
Then you systematically inspect the room to check if you can come up with a 
solution to every surface you see: Can you stand something in front of it?  
Can you move it out of the room? Can you pull a blanket over it? Use 
poster-gum to fasten something to it? Etc. Be inventive!

 Once your homebrew recording studio looks pretty much like a warzone you are 
ready to create clear and noise-free recordings... that is... if you can grab 
hold of a decent microphone!

 Have fun making a mess and recording :-)

**jaiger adds**:

I am by no means an expert on this.  The work I have done for this project is 
about all the experience I have.

That said, I have had good feedback on recordings performed in the following 
environments in my home.

1- inside my car, parked inside my closed garage

2- inside a walk-in closet with the closet and room doors closed

The closet is more comfortable than the car.

In both cases I did think of issues around "breaking up the surfaces" but I 
didn't want to truly make a mess around my house.  I was looking for places 
that I could minimize setup time, where I can just sit down and record.
