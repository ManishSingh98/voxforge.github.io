No, do not read punctuation marks out loud.

Please read the prompts as if you were reading them out loud to another person.

Use punctuation as you normally would... i.e. commas for a slight pause, period 
for a longer pause, and question marks with the same inflection as when you ask 
a question, etc.

You can also deviate from the punctuation if you want to, they are only there 
for a guide - just don't read the punctuation mark out loud (i.e. don't say the 
word "comma" if you encounter a comma "," in the text...).
