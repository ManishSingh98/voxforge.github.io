<b>Uncompressed audio</b> 

[Uncompressed audio] is audio without any compression applied to it.  This 
includes audio recorded using the [WAV] format (using [PCM] encoding) used by 
the VoxForge speech recording and uploading app.

<b>Compressed Audio:</b>

  - <b>[Lossless audio compression]</b> is where audio is compressed without losing any 
  information or degrading the quality at all.  Examples of lossless formats 
  includes WMA Lossless or FLAC.

  - <b>[Lossy audio compression]</b> attempts to discard as much 
  'irrelevant' data as possible from the original audio, thereby producing a
  file much smaller than the original that sounds almost identical. 
  This results in a much smaller filesize then lossless or uncompressed audio.
  Lossy audio formats include AC3, DTS, AAC, MPEG-1/2/3, Vorbis, and Real Audio.
