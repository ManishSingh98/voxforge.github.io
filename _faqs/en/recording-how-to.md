### Quiet Environment

Before you begin, you need to make sure that the room you are recording in is 
as [quiet as possible].  In addition, make sure you turn off you speakers 
*while recording* - to avoid acoustic feedback in your audio files.

### Adjust your Microphone 

Next you need to [adjust your microphone] for optimal pickup of your voice. 

If you have a headset microphone, this should be easy to do.  Your microphone 
should be a bit to the side and below your mouth (so the microphone won't 
pick-up your breathing), and no more than a half inch (1-2 cm) away.

### Recording Levels

Now you need to test your recording levels.  Click the "Record" button and begin 
speaking in your normal voice for a few seconds, and then click the "Stop" button.

Volume is Just Right
--------------------

Look at the Black Waveform Display box below the list of prompts.  Your voice 
should be loud enough so that the sections where you speak fill about one-quarter 
to one-half the size the height of the waveform display screen (as show in the 
image above). 

Too Loud
--------

![Volume is too Loud]({{ site.url }}/images/speechsubmission-tooloud.jpg)

Your recording should not be so loud that your waveform is clipped at the top, 
or that you get a message saying that "input is too loud" in the box below the 
upload button (see image above). 

If this occurs, please reduce your microphone volume and re-record your prompt.

Not Loud Enough
---------------

In addition, the volume of your recording should not be so low that you have 
little or no vertical height to the waveforms for your speech (see above).

If this occurs, please increase your microphone volume and re-record your prompt.
