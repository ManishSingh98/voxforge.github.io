VoxForge uses Public Domain Audio Books (LibriVox) recordings to create
derivative works which will be licensed under the [GPL]. 

This will not affect the legal status of the recording you submitted here or 
anywhere else (e.g. LibriVox). Therefore you will still be able to put your 
recording into the public domain (or it will remain in the public domain if 
it's already in there).
