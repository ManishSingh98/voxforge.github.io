**Free software** is [software] that gives users the four essential freedoms:

*   to run the program, for any purpose
*   to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as 
    you wish.  Access to the [source code] is a precondition for this. 
*   to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor, and

*   to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.  Access to the 
    [source code] is a precondition for this.

For more information, see the definition of [Free Software] on the 
[Free Software Foundation's] (FSF) website.  The FSF promotes the development
 and use of [free software], particularly the GNU operating system, used widely 
in its GNU/Linux variant.
