No, do not read punctuation marks out loud.

Please read the prompts as if you were reading them-out loud to another person.

Use punctuation as you normally would... i.e. commas for a slight pause, period for a longer pause, and question marks with the same inflection as when you ask a question, etc.

You can also deviate from the punctuation if you want to, they are only there for a guide - just don't read the punctuation mark out loud (i.e. don't say the word "comma" if you encounter a comma "," in the text...). 

If you want to... after you've recorded a few prompts with your normal voice (so that the acoustic model will can be trained with your voice... speech recognition engines recognize best the speech they have been trained with), you could record additional prompts as a question, or as an sports announcer, etc.  Be creative.  The important thing is to get a good mix of people, dialects and speaking styles.
