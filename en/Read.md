### Before you Begin Recording Prompts

Turn off any other audio programs on your PC (i.e. music players, audio
editors, etc.)

Position your mike so it does not pick up your breathing.  While
recording, try to minimize any non-speech noises (i.e. exhaling, taking
a breath, lip smacking, ...) or background noise. 

The black box near the bottom of your screen will display the audio
waveform of your recording. Please [record a test recording] to ensure
your microphone volume is not too loud or too soft.

The VoxForge applet works best with [Firefox] on Windows and Linux.

### Recording Prompts 

For each prompt line, please record your speech as follows:

1.  click the **Record** button,
2.  pause for half a second,
3.  **Read** the corresponding prompt sentence,
4.  pause for half a second, and then
5.  click the the **Stop** button.

If you make a mistake, click Record again to re-record your prompt.

Please [do not read the punctuation marks out loud].

Once you have completed recording all ten prompts the Upload button will
activate.  Click the **Upload** button to upload your entire submission
to the VoxForge repository as a single zip file.

**Repeat** the process (multiple submissions are encouraged!)
