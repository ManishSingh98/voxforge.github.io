VoxForge was set up to collect transcribed speech for use with [Free](faq/what-is-free-software) and  [Open Source](faq/what-is-open-source-software) [Speech Recognition Engines](faq/what-is-the-difference-between-a-speech-recognition-engine-and-a-speech-recognition-system) (on Linux, Windows and Mac). 

We will make available all submitted audio files under the [GPL](faq/what-is-gpl) license, and then 'compile' them into acoustic models for use with [Open Source](faq/what-is-open-source-software) speech recognition engines such as [CMU Sphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/html/cmusphinx.php), [ISIP](http://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/speech), [Julius](http://julius.sourceforge.jp/en_index.php) ([github](https://github.com/julius-speech/julius)) and [HTK](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/) (note: HTK has distribution restrictions).

## Why Do We Need Free GPL Speech Audio?

Most [acoustic models](faq/what-is-an-acoustic-model) used by 'Open Source' speech recognition (or Speech-to-Text) engines are [closed source](faq/what-is-closed-source-software).  They do not give you access to the speech audio and transcriptions (i.e. the [speech corpus](faq/what-is-a-speech-corpus-or-speech-corpora)) used to create the acoustic model. 

The reason for this is that Free and Open Source ('FOSS') projects are required to purchase large [speech corpora](faq/what-is-a-speech-corpus-or-speech-corpora) with restrictive licensing.  As of 2015, there is finally an excellent, large English corpus suitable for creating acoustic models [LibriSpeech ASR Corpus](http://www.openslr.org/12/).  The VoxForge corpus was used to help segment [Librivox audiobooks](https://librivox.org/) to create the corpus.  So the open source community has made good progress with English, but we still need speech samples from as many different computer environments as possible.
