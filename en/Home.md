VoxForge was set up to collect transcribed speech for use with [Free] and 
[Open Source], [Speech Recognition Engines].

The audio is recorded in [WAV] audio, a high quality [uncompressed] and 
[lossless] format.  Most open corpora are recorded in [lossy] formats (such 
as mp3 or vorbis).

The audio collected is meant to provide an wide and varied sample of different user 
recording environments - from line noise from their audio cards, poor quality 
microphones, and background noise of many different types.  This is not intended 
to be a fully 'clean speech' corpus, but will contain examples of clean and 
noisy speech, tagged as such so that acoustic model developers can extract
the audio best suited to their needs.
