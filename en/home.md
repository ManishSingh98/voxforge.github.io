VoxForge was set up to collect transcribed speech for use in the creation of 
acoustic models for [Free] and 
[Open Source], [Speech Recognition Engines].

Your speech is recorded in high quality, [uncompressed], [WAV] format.  Most 
open corpora are recorded in [lossy compressed] formats (such as mp3 or vorbis).

The collected audio is meant to provide an wide and varied sample of different user 
recording environments: from line noise from their audio cards, poor quality 
microphones, and background noise of many different types.  This is not intended 
to be a fully 'clean speech' corpus, but will contain examples of clean and 
noisy speech, tagged as such, so that acoustic model developers can extract
the audio best suited to their needs.

## How Can You Help?

[Record yourself reading some text] using the Speech Submission app and upload 
your recordings to the VoxForge server.
